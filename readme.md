###GMK 654 - Web GIS & LBS | Personal Web Page

This project is the outcome of the assignment within the GMK 654 - Web GIS & LBS course, aimed at enabling students to create their personal web pages using HTML, CSS, and the OpenLayers library for Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The project presents personal experiences, projects, and travel information via an interactive map.

##Project Goal and Features

This website is designed to achieve the following main objectives:

Personal Portfolio: To showcase the student's academic and professional experiences, projects, and areas of interest.

Web GIS Application: To present an interactive travel map (Travel Map) showing the geographic locations of visited places, using OpenLayers.

Technological Compliance: The project has been developed using at least three different HTML files (index.html, experience.html, projects.html, travel.html, etc.), in accordance with the assignment requirements.

##Technologies Used

The main technologies used in the development of the project are:

HTML5: For structuring the page layout.

CSS / Tailwind CSS: Modern CSS utility classes were used for fast and fully responsive design.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): Used to manage the Carousel (Slider) logic and OpenLayers map interactions.

OpenLayers (ol): Used in the Travel Map page to display the geographic locations of visited cities (Belgrade, Sarajevo, Skopje) and to provide pan/zoom functionality on the map.

##Travel Map Features

The travel.html page includes the following interactive features:

OpenLayers Map Display: A map showing the center of the visited Balkan countries.

Image Carousels: Slider cards displaying multiple photos for each city (Belgrade, Sarajevo, Skopje).

View on Map Functionality: When the button on the card is clicked, the map automatically and dynamically focuses on the relevant city center.

##Artificial Intelligence (AI) Usage

As required by the assignment instructions, assistance from AI tools (e.g., Gemini) was utilized during the development of this project.

The primary area where AI assistance was sought was Web GIS and Visualization Integration. This involved using AI to gain knowledge and learn the correct implementation methods for key components:

OpenLayers Integration
CSS Visualization and Animation
